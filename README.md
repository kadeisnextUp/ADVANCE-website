# Advance Website

# "The Mark of a Leader"

Advance is a professional development student organization founded by African American students in 1986, in response to the expressed need of students to enhance their career awareness and preparation for career success. ADVANCE was inspired by the objectives of the Corporate Orientation Program (CORP), which then operated under the Council on Career Development Minorities, Inc. Terry Davis, Former Assistant Director of the Career Development Center, along with four African American University of Cincinnati students, formed ADVANCE. Over the years, ADVANCE has remained a unique program among colleges and universities, receiving the distinguished Chevron Award from the National Association of Colleges and Employers for its outstanding program

In the fall semester of 2025, I (Kaden Sawyer) was appointed as the Director of Digital Technology. My first action was to create a more modern website for the organization, and I decided to make it open-source so it can be seamlessly updated over the years by others within the organization. I also put together a team of like-minded individuals (I am going to coin the term Advance devs for now) to help build the website and help develop other projects, so students have the opportunity to put more projects on their resume.
